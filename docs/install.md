# Installation
>
>
> The documentation and examples are written assuming you are running F.A.M. on a Mac and that the repository was cloned from GitHub. If you are using a different operating system you will need to adjust commands, drive letters, and paths accordingly. Additionally, it is assumed you have a basic knowledge of bash scripting to properly navigate within the terminal.
>
> Create a project directory and navigate inside to run the following command which will create a local clone of the F.A.M. repository:
```
git clone "https://github.com/Will-Carrara/Fallowed-Area-Mapping.git"
```
>
> ## Python
> F.A.M. requires Python 3.* 64-bit and at least 4GB of memory. A simple guide on installing python can be found [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/).

> ## Dependencies
> Please run the following command to install the external modules:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
