# Fallowed Area Mapping

> ### Abstract
> Working in collaboration with the California Department of Water Resources, scientists at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) have demonstrated the feasibility of using satellite imagery to track the extent of fallowed land in the Central Valley of California on a monthly basis.

> Satellite remote sensing offers an efficient and consistent way to provide quantitative assessments of drought impacts on agricultural production and increases in fallow acreage associated with reductions in surface water supplies. To provide quantitative measures of uncultivated agricultural acreage throughout the year, we developed a decision tree algorithm and applied it to timeseries data from Landsat satellites.

> ## Install
>
> Details on installing F.A.M and necessary modules can be found in the [installation instructions](docs/install.md).
>
> ## Workflow
> A detailed walk-through on the setup and operation of F.A.M. has been assembled in the following series of documentation contained in the following links:
> 1. [Data Acquisition](docs/data_acquisition.md)
> 2. [Running F.A.M.](docs/tutorial.md)
>
> ## Limitations
>
> Please note that this code is written for the data as it is currently provided, however the data and itâ€™s formatting is controlled by the data providers and by third-party hosts. The curators of F.A.M. will attempt to keep the package functional, however changes in the data and data availability may impact the functionality of F.A.M.
